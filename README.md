- 👋 Hi, I’m Bhruhathi
  I'm an agile developer and  maker blending hardware and software to solve real-world problems. At work and in personal projects—whether it's monitoring ACs, turning classic games multiplayer, or exploring brain signals with EEG—I’m always building, learning, and innovating.

- ⚡️Thing's I've worked on
  - 🧠 EEG-Based Project  
    → Leveraging machine learning to analyze EEG data from a 3-electrode setup (FP1, FP2, Mastoid).
  - 🛠️ IoT-based AC Monitoring System  
    → Using WCS1700 current sensors, real-time data transmission via Wi-Fi, and smart analysis to monitor traditional AC units without replacing them.
  - ✨ Ultrasonic Levitation  
    → Using focused sound waves and transducer arrays to levitate small particles — hands-free, physics-powered magic!

- 👀 I’m interested in
  - IoT systems that make everyday devices smarter 🔌📶
  - Exploring the boundaries of what sensors can do 🔍
  - Real-time data monitoring and visualization 📊 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning
  - Embedded C
